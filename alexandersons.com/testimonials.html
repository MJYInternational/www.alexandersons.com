												<p>We replaced plants in our front and back yard and added some lighting.  Paul and his team were great to work with through the whole process. I would recommend them to any of my friends.<br>-George G.</p>

												<p>I've used Alexander and Sons several times. They added a lawn, dug a trench for a new gas and electric line, poured concrete for a hot tub, and installed landscape lighting. Paul is easy to work with and knows his stuff. I never have to worry about quality because they do a good job, and when I notice problems they make it right quickly.<br>-George N.</p>

												<p>If you want beautiful workmanship, don't look farther than Paul and his crew... They did our driveway, courtyard, and pathways with exposed aggregate and bricks.  We couldn't be happier with the results.  Paul really listens, advises, and ensures that everything happens in a timely manner.<br>-Diane T.</p>

										<p>The demo and concrete were done in just a few days. The herringbone brickwork took quite a bit longer, but was totally worth it. Everyone was very professional, and Paul was especially responsive by email and phone. One hiccup was that the water main was broken in the demo because it was directly beneath the old concrete, instead of a foot or so below. No problem. Paul had a plumbing team out the same day and got the water back on by evening. And the water main needed to be upgraded to copper anyway. Would definitely hire Paul and company again!<br>-Bob M.</p>

												<p>The patio came out beautiful and I've received so many compliments. Each day, Paul's crew was on time, cleaned up and worked hard to complete the job well. Any future project (probably my front walkway next) I will not hesitate to hire Alexander and Sons.<br> -A B.</p>

												<p> Paul and team where there when they said they would be, worked efficiently, asked us for input without overwhelming details, and even cleaned everything up at the end. They are the real deal.<br>-Peter C.</p>

									<p>Alexander and Sons just recently finished our stamped concrete driveway and walkway to the front door. Paul was great to work with. He was easily accessible via phone and email and was at the project site everyday for several hours overseeing his crew. His crew was on-time, professional and did a great job cleaning up. We had to rework our existing driveway layout to meet the city requirements, and Paul came out several times at no additional cost to help us calculate and measure the yard and suggest layout designs. His price was good and he explained everything in detail.<br>-Jeff M.</p>
